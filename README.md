# Assignment - Create a basic layout with HTML and CSS


## Description

**Main story:**

We are creating a portfolio for a client. To get started we need a basic layout.
The client has requested a classic setup with a top menu bar, a footer bar and a center section for content. The center section should be divided in three columns.

The middle column will be used to display main content like projects. The left column should contain a picture and maybe some contact info, the right column should contain a small table filled with the clients skills.

**This assignment is about the layout only**
